FA-Covid Tracker is a web Based live COVID-19 daily Statistic Dashboard generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).

The problem I took up for the project was the COVID-19 related explanation. Nowadays, the entire world is completely frozen by the Corona virus. So I chose this project because this issue is timely and community-oriented.They will be able to learn about the spread of Corona virus to the public through this application and how it spreads in different countries.

Through this application, they will be able to clearly understand the impact internationally and nation-wide. The charts are attached to it so they can easily see how it spreads day by day.

 - Anyone can get updated with day to day COVID-19 cases around the world.
